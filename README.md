## üìú License

This project is open-source. Feel free to fork, modify, and use it as you see fit.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is ready for deployment. Here are two recommended strategies:

### **Option 1: Platform-as-a-Service (e.g., Render)**

The repository includes a `render.yaml` file for easy, one-click deployment on [Render](https://render.com).

1.  Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2.  Connect your repo to Render and create a new "Web Service".
3.  Add your `GEMINI_API_KEY` as an environment variable in the Render dashboard.
4.  Render will automatically build and deploy your application using the `render.yaml` configuration.

### **Option 2: Deploying on a VM (Linux/Windows)**

For full control, you can deploy on your own Virtual Machine. Detailed instructions for both **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)** and **Windows Server** can be found below:

<details>
<summary><b>Click to Expand: Linux VM Deployment Guide (Nginx/WSGI/Systemd)</b></summary>

1.  **Install Packages:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv nginx git -y
    ```
2.  **Clone Repo & Setup Environment:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your_repo_url> leetcoach && cd leetcoach
    python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=..." > .env
    ```
3.  **Create Systemd Service:** Create `/etc/systemd/system/leetcoach.service` to manage the application process.
4.  **Configure Nginx:** Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy to forward requests to the WSGI server and serve static files.
5.  **Start Services & Configure Firewall.**

*(For a complete walkthrough, refer to the detailed guide provided in our chat history).*

<summary><b>Click to Expand: Windows VM Deployment Guide (Waitress/NSSM)</b></summary>

This guide uses **Waitress** as the WSGI server and **NSSM (the Non-Sucking Service Manager)** to create a reliable Windows Service that runs in the background.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) (ensure you check "Add Python to PATH").
    *   Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
    *   Download [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/download) and place `nssm.exe` in a PATH directory (e.g., `C:\Windows\System32`).

2.  **Clone Repo & Setup Environment (in PowerShell as Admin):**
    ```powershell
    cd C:\
    git clone <your_repo_url> leetcoach && cd leetcoach
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install waitress
    # Create your .env file here
    ```

3.  **Create Windows Service with NSSM:**
    ```powershell
    nssm install leetcoach
    ```
    This opens the NSSM GUI. Configure the following tabs:
    *   **Application Tab:**
        *   **Path:** `C:\leetcoach\venv\Scripts\python.exe`
        *   **Startup directory:** `C:\leetcoach`
        *   **Arguments:** `-m waitress --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80 app:app`
    *   **Environment Tab:**
        *   Add your API key: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key`
    *   Click **Install service**.

4.  **Start the Service & Configure Firewall:**
    ```powershell
    nssm start leetcoach
    ```
    *   Open **Windows Defender Firewall** and create a new **Inbound Rule** to allow TCP traffic on **Port 80**.
